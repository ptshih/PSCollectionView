What is PSCollectionView?
---
It's a Pinterest style scroll view designed to be used similar to a UITableView.

It supports Portrait and Landscape orientations.

I built this as a hack to show my friends. Any suggestions or improvements are very welcome!

Coming soon... A fully functional demo app.

What is PSCollectionViewCell?
---
It's the equivalent of UITableViewCell

It implements base methods for configuring data and calculating height

*Note: You should subclass this!*

Want to see this code in a live app?
---
I use this in my iPhone/iPad app, Lunchbox.

Fully ARC compatible now

How to use:
---
Here's an example of creating an instance of PSCollectionView

```objc
self.collectionView = [[PSCollectionView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero];
self.collectionView.delegate = self; // This is for UIScrollViewDelegate
self.collectionView.collectionViewDelegate = self;
self.collectionView.collectionViewDataSource = self;
self.collectionView.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor];
self.collectionView.autoresizingMask = ~UIViewAutoresizingNone;
```

**Setting number of columns**

```objc
// Specify number of columns for both iPhone and iPad
if (isDeviceIPad()) {
    self.collectionView.numColsPortrait = 3;
    self.collectionView.numColsLandscape = 4;
} else {
    self.collectionView.numColsPortrait = 1;
    self.collectionView.numColsLandscape = 2;
}
```

**Add a header view**

```objc
UIView *headerView = ...
self.collectionView.headerView = headerView;
```

**Add a footer view**

```objc
UIView *footerView = ...
self.collectionView.footerView = footerView;
```    
    
**Reloading Data**

```objc
[self.collectionView reloadData];
```

**Delegate and DataSource**

```objc
- (Class)collectionView:(PSCollectionView *)collectionView cellClassForRowAtIndex:(NSInteger)index {
    return [PSCollectionViewCell class];
}

- (NSInteger)numberOfRowsInCollectionView:(PSCollectionView *)collectionView {
    return 0;
}

- (UIView *)collectionView:(PSCollectionView *)collectionView cellForRowAtIndex:(NSInteger)index {
    return nil;
}

- (CGFloat)collectionView:(PSCollectionView *)collectionView heightForRowAtIndex:(NSInteger)index {
    return 0.0;
}
```
